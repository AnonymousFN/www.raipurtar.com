        All season primer and designed to dry faster under all temperature conditions.
        
        Free flowing property permit coverage of 10-12 m2 per liter on new pipe surface while old and rough<br> pipe require 10% to 20% extra coverage depending upon pipe surface.<br><br>
        
        It can be used for internal coating of pipes as it has no taste or odour. <br><br>
        
        Application methodology - <br><br>
        
        Pipe Surface Preparation<br><br>
        
        Before applying RTP Primer - B, pipe surface prepration is of the utmost importance.<br> There are a number of suitable methods of pipe cleaning including -<br><br>
        
        (a) Sand or grit blasting<br><br>
        
        (b) Mechanical scraping and wire brushing.<br><br>
        
        Each method has its own attractions.<br><br>
         
        
        Anhydrous Mudgun Mass<br><br>
        
        This mass is used in blast furnace for closing the blast furnace metal tap hole, it is used by the Mudgun Machine.<br><br> This mass is supplied in cake shaped pieces, each weighing around 2 to 3 kgs approximately.<br> lt is drilled in L to I & L/2 hr intervals. During drilling process it gives excellent tap hole length and is free from coke - rust.<br> This mass can be used in every size/capacity of blast Furnaces. The special features<br><br> of anhydrous Mudgun Mass are as follows:-<br>
        
        1. Adequate plasticity at room temp. there by allowing its application without prior heating.<br><br>

        <br><br>
        1. Taphole length achieved 1.6 to 2 mts consistently which increases the quality of hot metal per tap and hence productivity.<br><br>
        
        2. Full Mushroom is formed inside the furnace which results in turbulence free tapping and hot metal flow.<br><br>
        
        3. Good workability to facilitate extrusion.<br><br>
        
        4. Due to higher taphole length and mushroom formation, coke rust during tapping is avoided<br><br>
        
        5. Consistency coking out time to ensure adequate strength of extruded material.<br><br>
        
        6. Lower volatiles to minimize the flame and gas evolutions.<br><br>
        
        7. Better drillability which reduces opening time & avoids lancing<br><br>
        
        8. Good shelf of 3-4 weeks.<br><br>
        
        Anhydrous Trough Mass<br><br>
        
        This mass is used in main runner and side slag runner of the blast furnace.<br><br> This is coarser powdered material of grain size 0 to 4 mm.<br> This material gives enough strength after complete ramming and drying of the bed. <br>This is a thermo sitting process, so computability increases after complete heating of the mabs. lt is suitable for various temperatures of liquid metal<br><br> and its high quality ensures longer refractory life. This mass is supplied in ready to use condition and no further<br> processing is required by the end user.<br><br>
        
        The salient features of the product are as follows:<br><br>
        
        1. Corrosion resistance from slag<br><br>
        
        2. Non-wettable to iron and slag<br><br>
        
        3. Thermal stability and shock resistance<br><br>
